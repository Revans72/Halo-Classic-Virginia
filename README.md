E-cigg tech test. 

Hi there,

The main content of the page is within the container div with the id of 'main'. 

So the header and footer will go above and below this. 

Please include all the links in the head tag in the order they appear in the code, my custom style sheet being last. 

For full disclosure I did go about 20mins over the 3hr time due to validation fixes and some styling fixes I wanted to make. 

I keep the colours to the ones specified in the test doc. The only colours the are diffrent are the focus border on buttons and the arrow for the accordian buttons which are the default bootstrap colours. 

I did intent to alter these colours to match the branding but ran out of time to do so. 

I really enjoyed doing this test and it push me to think on the fly, so I wanted to thank you for giving me the oppotunity to try this test. 

If you have any feedback for me please let me know. 

Best Regards,
Robert Evans
